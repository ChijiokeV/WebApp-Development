Here i have uploaded Task number 4 and 6

Task 4:
JavaScript can be used for interactive web pages and to develop algorithms that solve mathematical problems,
for example, by outputting the Fibonacci sequence with arbitrary start and end points. Choose a more complex
mathematical problem and create JavaScript code that represents it. Examples of suitably complex problems
include approximation of polynomials, Fourier analysis, statistical methods (e.g., linear regression), mortgage
repayments, and univariate optimization methods. The output does not have to be generated via a web page: it
can be displayed via the console. The source code should be commented line by line.



Task 6:
Your company tasks you with developing an order form for computer components. Develop a web page using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate how the solution might function and appear visually. Please develop
the web page as a “one pager.” External links to available frameworks are allowed.
